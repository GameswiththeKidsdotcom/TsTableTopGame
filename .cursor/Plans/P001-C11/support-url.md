# Support URL for App Store Connect

**Support URL** (use in App Store Connect app version metadata):

```
https://github.com/GameswiththeKidsdotcom/TsTableTopGame
```

## Rationale

- GitHub repo is reachable and provides:
  - Issues for bug reports and feature requests
  - README / project info
  - Contact via repository maintainers
- Complies with App Review Guideline 1.5 (Support URL required).
- No placeholder; live URL with support path.

## App Store Connect Entry

When creating or editing the app in App Store Connect:

1. Open your app → App Information (or version-specific metadata).
2. Find **Support URL**.
3. Enter: `https://github.com/GameswiththeKidsdotcom/TsTableTopGame`
4. Save.

The Support URL can be changed later in App Store Connect without a new build.
